- Promotional photos that act as advertisement for any paid version of the app
- Extended caching (compared to out-of-the box from the android Gallery component)

This android app can be used as a basis for your own slideshow or photoframe app. Feel free to fork it!

Currently, it support the following back-ends:
- (recommended) Flickr public set (through the class FlickrPublicSetBackend)
- OPML over HTTP (through the class OPMLBackend)
- SmugMug Recent photos (through the class SmugMugRecentBackend)

In order to create a new app, search through the code for TODO-FORK and make sure you provide the necessary updates at these points.
